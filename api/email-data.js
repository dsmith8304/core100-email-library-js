This is not merely a product, but our compass pointing toward market leadership.",

Let's discuss how to approach this properly—through Caprai.",

Now we ask two questions—simple, but critical: What if sales are worse than expected? What if they're better? In other words: What happens if Shirley oversold it? Or if you actually created more demand than you planned for? These aren't hypotheticals. They're scenarios you need to be ready for. Ask me how to find out the consequences.",

Forecast your worst fears for sales. What if demand crashes? Go to the Production display. Build to your fondest hopes. What if everything works better than expected. Go to the Finance display. Examine the results. You just forecast a ton of inventory. How much cash is left?. You'll start to see the shape of risk—your risk. "

      "Step 2. On the Finance display, look for 'Closing Cash Position'. If it is negative, you can expect a visited by Big Al. But what if it's positive? Make it worse to see what would happen. Go back to Marketing. Set your worst case forecast to 1000. Now look at your Closing Cash Position. That negative number? That's a visit from Big Al. Ask Caprai to discuss the relationship between inventory expansions and emergency loans.",
      "Step 3. Borrow enough Current Debt to make your Closing Cash Position positive. Your natural instinct to avoid Big Al is to limit your production schedule. But that can kill your profits because you risk stocking out. To see that, forecast 1700 in Marketing. Use your production schedule to compare cash positions when you only produce 1200 and stock out. Then at 1500. Mama Mia!",
      "Step 4. Now that you understand the risks, put your worst case on the Marketing display, and your best case on the Production display. This forces your system to pay for your worst case inventory. If you have any cash left, and your worst case is truly a worst case, you cannot get an emergency loan from an inventory expansion. Ask Caprai to explain why."
